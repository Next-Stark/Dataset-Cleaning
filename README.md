# Dataset Cleaning

The data cleaning process in these repositories involves using a combination of Excel, SQL, and Python tools to clean and preprocess the datasets. Excel is used for tasks such as data validation, filtering, and formatting. SQL is utilized for data manipulation, transformation, and filtering operations on relational databases. Python is employed for more complex data cleaning tasks, such as data imputation, text parsing, and data normalization. The combination of these tools allows for efficient and effective data cleaning, resulting in datasets that are organized, consistent, and ready for analysis and decision-making.
