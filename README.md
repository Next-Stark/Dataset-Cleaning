# Dataset Cleaning

The goal of the data cleaning process in these repositories is to transform datasets into a more organized and understandable format, making them suitable for analysis and informed decision-making. By removing inconsistencies, errors, and redundancies in the data, the cleaned datasets are made easier to read and interpret. This helps to ensure data quality and reliability, enabling effective analysis and decision-making based on accurate and meaningful insights.
